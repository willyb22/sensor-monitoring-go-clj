# Project Overview

This project is a learning exercise in Go and Clojure.

- **Go**: Used as the backend and for generating random data.
- **Clojure**: Used for data analytics, batch monitoring, and displaying results.

I created this project to explore both languages and their strengths in backend development and data processing.
